## About

[Only Up 64](https://romhacking.com/hack/only-up-64) is a romhack created by [Kaze](https://romhacking.com/user/Kaze) and [thelegendofzenia](https://romhacking.com/user/thelegendofzeina)

## Mod Description

This whole mod is one big, tall level that takes around 25 minutes to complete - if you don't fall. Climb the biggest level ever made! (as of today)

You can use the GP dive and the GP spin to have an easier time in this game but difficult mode is doing it without them!

## Only Up 64 Map Blender File

This wouldn't be possible without Kaze releasing the Blender file for the map. Here is my modified one for sm64coopdx: [Only Up 64 Blender File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PRjuysbOzZa5if1Z0gtNwF1o1D6IrDIq/view)

## Only Up 64 Mario Blender File

* The Mario model wouldn't be possible without Kaze. Thanks Kaze for permission to use it in this port.

* Thank you SonicTheHedgeHog64 (originally known as ThePerfectMario64) for post-processing the textures to work correctly.

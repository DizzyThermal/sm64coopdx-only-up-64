## About

[Only Up 64](https://romhacking.com/hack/only-up-64) is a romhack created by [Kaze](https://romhacking.com/user/Kaze) and [thelegendofzenia](https://romhacking.com/user/thelegendofzeina)

## Mod Description

This whole mod is one big, tall level that takes around 25 minutes to complete - if you don't fall. Climb the biggest level ever made! (as of today)

You can use the GP dive and the GP spin to have an easier time in this game but difficult mode is doing it without them!
